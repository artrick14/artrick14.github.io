            <h2> It's Been a Purrrrrfect September </h2>

            <h3> September 26, 2022 </h3>
            <p> Hello All, </p>

            <p> Kiki Palmer here. This September has been action packed! 
                Mom and dad have been letting me explore some more. They 
                still don’t trust me to go outside unleashed because I am 
                such an adrenaline junky and will hop any fence if I see 
                something cool outside. One night, our neighbor’s cat was 
                loose—I saw it and launched myself right over the fence!
            </p>
            <p> I have had lots of visitors come see me this month. The most 
                notable one was my cousin Parmesan, she’s a golden retriever. 
                She hasn’t grasp the fact that I don’t speak dog, so I didn’t 
                understand A WORD she was saying when she was trying to talk to me. 
                I did really well though. It was so nice seeing my family members.  
            </p>
            <p>
                I also have been busting it down at night
            </p>
            <p> My goals for October are to see a bat, do some more yoga and 
                see the musical Cats. I also want to see my fellow feline 
                friends The Panthers play but I don’t understand much football, 
                so it may be a waste of a ticket if mom and dad get me one. 
                Have been craving a glizzy though.  I also want to ride a roller 
                coaster, but Dad said I will never meet the height and weight 
                requirements for Fury 365 at Carowinds. I have also been making 
                hella biscuits. 
            </p>

            <h2> Updates on Website </h2><br>
        
            <h3> September 3, 2022 </h3>
            <p> Dear Fans, </p>
            <p> I wanted to reach out to apologize for how long my website is taking. 
                I really wish it could be done faster but we are taking the time we 
                need in order to make sure it is the best it can be. I cannot give an 
                exact time line of what this website may look like, but progress is 
                always being made. With all this in mind, this can be my first 
                newsletter! So thank you all for being so patient and will reach 
                out with updates moving forward.
            </p>
            <p> Yours Truly, </p>
